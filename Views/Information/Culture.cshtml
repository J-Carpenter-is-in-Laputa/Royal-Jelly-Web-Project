            Narrative structure is important to analyze in media. Whether it’s the hero’s journey, the chosen one, or love at first sight. All of these could also be in
            the same story. How we tell stories is important if we want to communicate ideas and deciding what medium to do that through can be just as important

            This is less of an analysis and more so a celebration of the stories that carry on into new medium. Recently I saw the new Count of Monte Cristo movie and really enjoyed it.
            I'm not sure if I'll ever read the book so having the story remain accessible is great, although reading is great too. I also loved the Les Misérables when I watched it.

        <p>
            This is just a comment on how important it is to recognize and use rhetoric in life. The main uses of rhetoric are through logos, pathos, and ethos in which is an appeal to
            either logic, emotion, or ethics. these can be used simultaneously for greater impact. A novel like "To Kill a Mockingbird" may have an appeal to all three.
