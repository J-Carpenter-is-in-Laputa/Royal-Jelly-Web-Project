            Databases are so prevalent in everyone’s lives and sometimes may feel invasive. User profiles can be created on consumers or "people" storing their
            information for better business efficiency in marketing products, inventory management, and future business decisions. Data storage has gotten much cheaper and more efficient
            because of SSD'S or Solid-State Drives.

        <h3 class="section-heading">Relational Databases</h3>
        <p>
            Invented in the 1970s relational databases are the most popular type used today. Other types like Object-Oriented ones were invented later, but the price of them was initially
            costly enough for weak adaptation. Data is organized into tables with columns and rows, each table having a distinct primary key for each row and being connected to
            other tables by the primary which becomes a foreign key when its placed into another table to join them.
