# Royal-Jelly-Web-Project
This is built using ASP.NET Core MCV. 
- Code Editor used was Visual Studio Community 2022 and sql server express for the database.
- If you want to run the code you'll need to reconfigure the appsettings.json file for what database you use and update the database in the terminal.
- I recommend using the code editor I used for installing the Microsoft design, Microsoft tool, and Microsoft sql server packages I used to make this.
