# Royal-Jelly-Web-Project
This is built using the ASP.NET Core MCV. 
- Code Editor used was Visual Studio Community 2022 also used sql server express.
- If you want to run the code you'll need to reconfigure the appsettings.json file and update the database in the terminal.
- I also recommend using the code editor I used and Installing Microsoft design,tool, and sql server packages
